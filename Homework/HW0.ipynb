    "Welcome to AM 207 (http://am207.github.io/2016/).  In this class, we will be using a variety of tools that will require some initial configuration. To ensure everything goes smoothly moving forward, we will set up the majority of those tools in this homework. While some of this will likely be dull, doing it now will enable us to do more exciting work in the weeks that follow without getting bogged down in further software configuration. We are explicitly reserving the first week of the course for this assignment to give you time to do all the neccessary setup. Please use this time. Sometimes getting Pymc to work can be a bit tricky. \n",

Use the staff e-mail (am207tas@gmail.com) only for individual requests. All homework assignments, and project descriptions will be announced on Piazza.

    "## Programming expectations\n",
    "\n",
    "All the assignments and labs for this class will use Python and, for the most part, the browser-based IPython notebook format you are currently viewing. Knowledge of Python is not a prerequisite for this course, **provided you are comfortable learning on your own as needed**. While we have strived to make the programming component of this course straightforward, we will not devote much time to teaching prorgramming or Python syntax. Basically, you should feel comfortable with:\n",
    "\n",
    "* How to look up Python syntax on Google and StackOverflow.\n",
    "* Basic programming concepts like functions, loops, arrays, dictionaries, strings, and if statements.\n",
    "* How to learn new libraries by reading documentation.\n",
    "* Asking questions on StackOverflow or Piazza.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many online tutorials to introduce you to scientific python programming. A small sample below\n",
    "\n",
    "* [An intro to scientific python](https://github.com/jrjohansson/scientific-python-lectures) that is very nice. Lectures 1-4 are most relevant to this class.\n",
    "* [Idiomatic Python](http://python.net/~goodger/projects/pycon/2007/idiomatic/handout.html)\n",
    "* [A video intro](http://pyvideo.org/video/2744/the-wonderful-world-of-scientific-computing-with) from SciPy 2014.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Getting and installing Python\n",
    "\n",
    "You will be using Python throughout the course, including many popular 3rd party Python libraries for scientific computing. [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads) is an easy-to-install bundle of Python and most of these libraries. We **strongly** recommend that you use Anaconda for this course. If you insist on using your own Python setup instead of Anaconda, we will not provide any installation support, and are not responsible for you loosing points on homework assignments in case of inconsistencies. \n",
    "\n",
    "**For this course we are using Python 2.7, not Python 3.**\n",

    "### Installing Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "The Anaconda Python distribution is an easily-installable bundle of Python and many of the libraries used throughout this class. Unless you have a good reason not to, we recommend that you use Anaconda.\n",

    "1. Download the [appropriate version](http://continuum.io/downloads) of Anaconda. Make sure it is Python 2.7. \n",
    "1. Follow the instructions on that page to run the installer\n",
    "1. Test out the IPython notebook: open a Terminal window, and type `ipython notebook`. Or use the Anaconda Launcher which might have been deposited on your desktop. A new browser window should pop up. \n",
    "1. Click `New` at the upper right corner to create a new notebook file (choose Python 2). A new notebook should open in a new tab. **Trick**: give this notebook a unique name by clicking on `Untitled`, like `my-little-rose`. Use Spotlight (upper right corner of the mac desktop, looks like a maginifier) to search for this name. In this way, you will know which folder your notebook opens in by default.\n",

    "### Windows Users\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Download the [appropriate version](http://continuum.io/downloads) of Anaconda. Make sure it is Python 2.7\n",
    "1. Follow the instructions on that page to run the installer. This will typically create a directory at `C:\\Anaconda`\n",
    "1. Test it out: start the Anaconda launcher, which you can find in `C:\\Anaconda` or, in the Start menu. Start the IPython notebook. A new browser window should open. \n",
